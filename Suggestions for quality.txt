Suggestions for User Interface Improvements
1) User should able to differentiate Server response of the executed apis and other Status Code and its Details
2) While executing apis, can add one feature to authenticate api like Basic Authentication, API Key, OAuth etc
3) For POST api can add feature Import to import json data and to execute the api
4) Can add feature Environments to create variable and to use that variable in the url
5) Can add these apis as well PUT and DELETE
